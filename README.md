# Cap'n Web Python

> ⚠️ **Beta Version** - This library is under active development and not yet production-ready. APIs may change. Use at your own risk in production environments.

A complete Python implementation of the [Cap'n Web protocol](https://github.com/cloudflare/capnweb) - a capability-based RPC system with promise pipelining, structured errors, and multiple transport support.

## What's in the Box

**Core Features:**
- **Capability-based security** - Unforgeable object references with explicit disposal
- **Promise pipelining** - Batch multiple dependent calls into single round-trips
- **Multiple transports** - HTTP Batch, WebSocket, and WebTransport/HTTP/3
- **Type-safe** - Full type hints compatible with pyright/mypy
- **Async/await** - Built on Python's asyncio
- **Bidirectional RPC** - Full peer-to-peer capability passing
- **100% Interoperable** - Fully compatible with TypeScript reference implementation

**Beta Status:**
- 744 tests passing, 70% coverage
- Clean hook-based architecture
- Full protocol compliance

## Why Use Cap'n Web?

**Traditional RPC has problems:**
- No security model (anyone can call anything)
- No resource management (memory leaks)
- Poor performance (round-trip per call)

**Cap'n Web solves these:**
- **Security**: Capabilities are unforgeable - you can only call what you have a reference to
- **Resource Management**: Explicit disposal with reference counting prevents leaks
- **Performance**: Promise pipelining batches dependent calls into one round-trip
- **Flexibility**: Pass capabilities as arguments - the server decides who gets access

## Installation

```bash
# Clone and install from source
git clone https://github.com/nikileshsa/capnweb-python.git
cd capnweb-python
uv sync

# For WebTransport support (optional):
uv pip install aioquic
```

## Quick Start

**Server (HTTP Batch):**
```python
import asyncio
from aiohttp import web
from capnweb import RpcTarget, RpcError, aiohttp_batch_rpc_handler

class Calculator(RpcTarget):
    async def call(self, method: str, args: list) -> any:
        match method:
            case "add": return args[0] + args[1]
            case "multiply": return args[0] * args[1]
            case _: raise RpcError.not_found(f"Unknown method: {method}")

    async def get_property(self, name: str) -> any:
        raise RpcError.not_found(f"Property '{name}' not found")

async def main():
    calc = Calculator()
    app = web.Application()
    app.router.add_post("/rpc/batch", lambda req: aiohttp_batch_rpc_handler(req, calc))
    runner = web.AppRunner(app)
    await runner.setup()
    await web.TCPSite(runner, "127.0.0.1", 8080).start()
    await asyncio.Event().wait()

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Client:**
```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp
from capnweb.batch import new_http_batch_rpc_session

async def main():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as http:
        stub = await new_http_batch_rpc_session(
            "http://localhost:8080/rpc/batch", 
            http_client=http
        )
        result = await stub.add(5, 3)
        print(f"5 + 3 = {result}")  # Output: 8

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Capability Passing** (bidirectional RPC):
```python
# Server returns a capability, client calls methods on it directly
account = await main_stub.createAccount(1000.0)
balance = await account.getBalance()  # Pythonic API!
await account.deposit(500.0)
```

## Current Status

**Transports:**

- ✅ Promise pipelining
- ✅ Expression evaluation (including `.map()`)
- ✅ Bidirectional RPC (full capability passing)
- ✅ Reference counting & disposal
- ✅ Structured errors with proper code propagation
- ✅ ValueCodec & CapabilityCodec architecture

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ 744 tests passing (100% success rate)
- ✅ 70% test coverage

| `calculator/` | HTTP Batch | Simple RPC calculator with error handling |
| `batch-pipelining/` | HTTP Batch | Promise pipelining demonstration |
| `peer-to-peer/` | HTTP Batch | Bidirectional RPC (Alice & Bob) |
| `chat/` | WebSocket | Real-time chat with callbacks |

## Protocol Compliance

This implementation follows the [Cap'n Web protocol specification](https://github.com/cloudflare/capnweb/blob/main/protocol.md).

**Interoperability:**
Designed to be compatible with the TypeScript reference implementation. Interop test suite available in `interop/` directory.

## Acknowledgments & Key Improvements from Original Fork

This project is based on [py-capnweb](https://github.com/abilian/py-capnweb) by Abilian SAS.

**Why a separate repo?** The original implementation had [several architectural issues](https://github.com/abilian/py-capnweb/issues/5) that required a major refactor to fix properly. Rather than attempting incremental patches, we rebuilt core components from scratch while preserving the overall design.

### Key Improvements from Original

**Architecture:**
- Refactored `ValueCodec` and `CapabilityCodec` architecture for cleaner wire format handling
- Introduced `BidirectionalSession` for full duplex RPC communication
- Added `WebSocketServerTransport` and `WebSocketClientTransport` for persistent connections
- Implemented proper capability table management (imports/exports/promises)

**Full Bidirectional Streaming:**
- Server can now call methods on client-provided callbacks
- Real-time push notifications from server to client
- Progress callbacks for long-running operations
- Symmetric RPC - both peers can export and import capabilities

**Error Handling:**
- Fixed error code propagation (errors preserve their original codes through the RPC chain)
- `RpcError.from_wire()` for proper wire-to-error conversion
- Structured errors with `bad_request`, `not_found`, `permission_denied`, `internal` codes

**Public API:**
- Added `create_stub()` factory for ergonomic capability creation from `RpcTarget`
- Exported `RpcStub`, `RpcPromise` for direct use
- Pythonic method calls: `await stub.method(args)` instead of `stub._hook.call()`

**Examples:**
- 10 comprehensive examples demonstrating all features
- All examples use public API patterns (no internal `_hook` access)
- Each example tested and verified working

**Testing:**
- 744 tests with 70% coverage
- Production feature tests (chat, task-queue, data pipeline, pub/sub, etc.)
- Stress tests for concurrent operations
